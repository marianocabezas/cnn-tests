# cnn-tests
Tests to generate feature vectors to train Deep Learning algorithms based on the Theano and Lasagne modules for Python 2.7

## Future
The goal is to implement several tests to generate features, and different CNN/CEN configurations to test. TODO:

- [ ] Generate a vector of 3D features to be trained
- [ ] Fenerate test and train data
- [ ] Generate CNN examples
- [ ] Generate CEN examples
