# cnn-tests
Tests to generate feature vectors to train Deep Learning algorithms based on the Theano and Lasagne modules for Python 2.7

## Future
The goal is to implement several tests to generate features, and different CNN/CEN configurations to test. TODO:

- [x] Generate a vector of 3D features to be trained
- [x] Generate test and train data
- [x] Generate CNN examples
- [x] Generate CEN examples (check my other [repository](https://github.com/marianocabezas/miccai_challenge2016) for the nets)
- [ ] Integrate this module as a submodule of the miccai challenge repository
